# Overview
As a software engineering student, i would like to explore about Artificial Intelligence. So, i choose Computer Vision topic and doing Facial Emotion Recognition humans expression using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). In this case i'm using different CNN architectures with transfer learning techniques:
ResNet50 and VGG16.

You can find my paper here: *Coming soon
